2.----A brief description of the program and how it can be used-----
The provided Python script creates a simple supermarket shopping experience with a graphical user interface (GUI) using the Tkinter library. Here's how the program can be used:

1.Launching the Application: Execute the script main.py to start the application.
2.Category Selection: Upon launching the application, a main window titled "Supermarket" will appear. It contains buttons representing different categories such as Vegetables, Fruits, Dairy Products, and Meat and Poultry. Click on a category button to browse items within that category.
3.Item Search: Within each category, a search window will appear. Enter a query in the search window to find specific items within the selected category.
4.Viewing Item Details: The application displays the name, quantity, and price of items matching the search query. If an item is found, it will be listed along with its details.
5.Buying Items: To purchase an item, click on the "Buy" button next to the item. The application will decrement the available quantity of the item, and the quantity displayed will update accordingly.
6.Payment: After selecting items, click on the "Pay" button located in the main window. This will open a payment window where you can enter your card details. Enter a valid 16-digit card number, a 3-digit security code, and the expiry date (in MM/YYYY format) of the card. Click on "Confirm Payment" to complete the transaction. If payment is successful, a message will be displayed, thanking you for shopping.
7.Exiting the Application: To exit the application, click on the "Quit" button in the category selection window.
This program provides a basic simulation of supermarket shopping, allowing users to browse items, select items for purchase, and complete payment. It's a simple yet effective way to demonstrate GUI programming with Tkinter in Python.
